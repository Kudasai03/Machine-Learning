# Machine Learning
In today's digital era, the use of technology-driven payment methods is increasingly replacing traditional payment methods. Tools such as bank cards, credit cards, and e-wallets are gaining dominance due to their convenience in consumer transactions. Among these, credit cards, in particular, are a popular payment method widely used in daily shopping transactions.

Recognizing the importance of this trend, a team has conducted analysis on the "Customer Dataset," containing information on about 9000 credit card customers over 6 months. The team's goal is to gain a better understanding of customer behavior when using credit cards and to classify them into groups with common characteristics. This helps businesses have an overview of the market, enabling them to develop effective and appropriate marketing strategies.
